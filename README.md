### Deliverables
Links to both the NodeJS Server repo, and the React App repo.
* The NodeJS Server should:
	- [x] Consume and store the feed data from the feeds above, in a database.
	- [x] Contain endpoints that allowing the React app to consume data from the database.
	- [x] Be simple and straightforward to run. Think `yarn start` or `npm start`.
* The React app should:
	- [x] Consume the NodeJS API, and will feed data into the components.
	- [x] Also, be simple and straighforward to get running.

### Possible improvements and optimizations
Here are some improvements that could be made:
* A testing suite, such as Jest, could be used 
* A production build of webpack could be generated (compressed and uglified)
* Typechecking could be used ie. *React PropTypes*
* Another database could be used for caching data (ie. *Redis*)
